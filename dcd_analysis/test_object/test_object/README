Thanks for using the elastic-network guided DNA origami method from
the Aksimentiev group.


## GENERAL 
Download and install NAMD from
http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=NAMD

Below we assume the default project name 'origami'; substitute with
the custom name you supplied.


## UNIX
Open a terminal in this directory and type:

/path/to/namd/charmrun ++local +p8 /path/to/namd/namd2 +netpoll origami.namd 2>&1 | tee output/origami-1.log

where '/path/to/namd' is substituted with the path under which NAMD
was installed and the +p8 option indicates that NAMD should utilize 8
cpu cores. Usually best performance is achieved by using exactly the
number of available cores or one fewer, but you may wish to
experiment.

Depending on your hardware, the size of your DNA, and the degree to
which it is initially out of equilibrium, it may take several days for
the simulation to finish. We recommend monitoring your simulation
using VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).


## WINDOWS 
You will need to install Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/), with openssh
installed and configured. You can then start a bash session and follow
the instructions for Unix. 

Please visit http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/wiki/index.cgi?NamdOnWindows 
for more instructions.
